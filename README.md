./vendor/bin/psalm-plugin enable 'VeeWee\Reflecta\Psalm\Plugin'
```
> Requires vimeo/psalm 5+

## Components

This package provides following components:

* [ArrayAccess](/docs/array-access.md): Helps you read from and write to arrays.
* [Iso](/docs/isomorphisms.md): Provides bidirectional transformations on your data.
* [Lens](/docs/lens.md): Separate your data from it's structure
* [Reflect](/docs/reflect.md): Helps you read from and write to objects in a runtime-safe context.
